# Swarmie-ROS

A ROS (Robot Operating System) controller framework for the Swarmie robots used in the [NASA Swarmathon](http://swarmathon.cs.unm.edu), a national swarm robotics competition. This particular framework is a ROS implementation of the [iAnt](http://iant.cs.unm.edu) CPFA (central-place foraging algorithm) developed at the University of New Mexico

This repository contains:

1. Source code for ROS libraries (i.e. packages) that control different aspects of the Swarmie robot, including localization, mapping, mobility, and obstacle and target detection
2. 3D .STL models for the physical Swarmie build 
3. Bash shell scripts for initializing simulated Swarmies in the Gazebo simulator, as well as physical Swarmies

###Quick Start Installation Guide

Swarmie-ROS is designed and tested exclusively on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr) and ROS Indigo Igloo. This framework may compile and run correctly under other versions of Ubuntu and ROS, but **NOTE** that these other systems are untested and are therefore not supported.

#####1. Installing ROS Indigo

Follow the detailed instructions for installing ROS Indigo under Ubuntu 14.04 [here](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu). We recommend the Desktop-Full installation, which includes the Gazebo 2 simulator.

#####2. Installing additional required ROS libraries
