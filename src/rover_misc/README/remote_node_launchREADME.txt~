This script remotely starts up the ros nodes on a Swarmie.

Before starting this script you first must be connected to the "robot" wireless router and make sure that the Swarmie you want to start is turned on.

Also, you must at least start roscore in another terminal window prior to running the script. This will ensure that the onboard nodes have a roscore to use.

The syntax of the script is

./remote_node_launch.sh [NETWORK NAME] [USER NAME]

As of now, the network name is ksc. So, if I wanted to start the nodes on shemp I would type in a terminal window:

./remote_node_launch.sh ksc shemp

and hit enter.

This script ssh's into the Swarmie and starts up the rover_onboard_node_launch.sh script that is located on all of the Swarmies. When the script is finished you will be able to interact with the ssh connection of the Swarmie you have choosen.

To change the nodes that are launched, you will need to edit the rover_onboard_node_launch.sh script that is located on the Swarmies. A copy is also located in rover_scripts directory.

A copy of remote_node_launch.sh is located in the rover_scripts directory
